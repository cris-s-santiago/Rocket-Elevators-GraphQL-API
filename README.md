# README

# Problem description - This exercise is from the Week 8 of the "Odyssey" program offered by CodeBoxx. This code is written in c# and ruby on rails. The task this week is about offering and Exposing a Service on the Internet using Apllication Programming Interfaces (API's).

The task was to create a requestable API via GraphQl such that it is necessary to use another more suitable technology to restore the data coming from two separate data sources in the same request.

Source 1: The Postgres decision database
Source 2: The MySQL operational database

1. Retrieving the address of the building, the beginning and the end of the intervention for a specific intervention.
2. Retrieving customer information and the list of interventions that took place for a specific building
3. Retrieval of all interventions carried out by a specified employee with the buildings associated with these interventions including the details (Table BuildingDetails) associated with these buildings.


# Deliverables

An extended Data Warehouse on Postgres 
Fictitious data fed into the FactInterventions table and corresponding to data from the operational database
An API allowing GraphQL queries, deployed on the Heroku services:

Examples of GraphQL queries that can be applied to the API and which return results for each question asked in the requirements.


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
